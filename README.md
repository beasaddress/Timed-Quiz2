# Timed-Quiz2
A series of JavaScript related questions that are timed and graded.

Using this application, you will start by seeing a big pink "Start" at the center of the screen. Users are able to click the button, and then presented with the rules of the quiz. Once they click the "next" button a 60 second timer start counting down. Users have 1 minute to quickly complete the 5 javascript realted questions. If they run out of time, their score is zero. If they answer incorrectly, 10 seconds is deducted from their score. Since it is a speed test, the more time you have left, the higher your score is. When all questions have been answered, the game is over and the user is able to see their results. If they choose to do so, they are able to save their Initials and score.
